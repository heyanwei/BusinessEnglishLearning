### Episode 4 Any Other Business?

任何其他议题

Has everybody got a copy of the agenda?

Would you mind taking minutes John? 你介意做一下会议记录吗

Not at all.

Good. Well, then let's get started.

First of all, thank you everyone for attending at short notice. 首先， 感谢每个人一接到通知就来参加会议

As you know, the objective of this meeting of the Capital Works committee is to discuss a proposal for some        urgent building work at our Southside plant.

As we've got to reach a decision which may involve spending we'll run it as a formal meeting.

Now, you've read the proposal, so without further ado, I'd like to open it up for discussion.

Perhaps if we can start with you Tan - what's your view?

......

So to sum up - I think we are all aware that some urgent work does need to be done. 总结来说，我想我们都知道有些紧急工作需要去做。

And we will need to work on a longer term plan for a major refit.

Well, if there's no more discussion we'll put it to a vote.

We're recommending that tenders be called for the urgent work needed.

All those in favour? 都赞成吗

All those against?都反对吗

Then that's agreed.

Any other business? 还有其他事情吗？

Then we'll close the meeting.

Thank you everyone.

The next meeting will be in two weeks, at the same time.
