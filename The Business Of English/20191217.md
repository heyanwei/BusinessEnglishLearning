No, thank you.

Excuse me, is anyone sitting here?

No, please have a seat.

That's better. My feet are killing me.

Have you been here long?

What about yourself? Do you live in Sydney?

I'm going to Melbourne later. What's the weather like there?

Not too good in winter, but at the moment it should be okay.
